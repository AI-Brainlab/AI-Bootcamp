    "- In this course, we'll be utilizing [Chat Models](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#chat-models), which process a series of messages as inputs and generate chat responses as outputs. LangChain itself doesn't host any Chat Models, so we rely on integrations with third-party services.\n",
    "- For this course, we'll primarily use [AzureChatOpenAI](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/) due to its popularity and performance. Please make sure you have the `OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` set correctly.\n",
    "- Let's verify if your `OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` are included in the `.env` file. If they're missing, you'll be prompted to provide them."

It helps cover costs that could otherwise lead to significant financial strain.\\n\\n2. **Risk Management**: By transferring the risk of loss to an insurance company, individuals and businesses can manage their exposure to potential financial setbacks.\\n\\n3. **Peace of Mind**: Knowing that you have insurance coverage can provide peace of mind, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your life or business without the constant worry of potential financial loss.\\n\\n4. **Legal Requirements**: Certain types of insurance, such as auto insurance or workers' compensation, are legally required in many places. Having the necessary coverage helps you comply with the law.\\n\\n5. **Access to Services**: Health insurance, for example, can provide access to necessary medical services that might otherwise be unaffordable.\\n\\n6. **Support for Recovery**: In the event of a loss, insurance can help individuals and businesses recover more quickly by providing the necessary funds to rebuild or replace what was lost.\\n\\n7. **Investment in Future**: Some insurance products, like life insurance or annuities, can also serve as investment vehicles, providing benefits in the long term.\\n\\nWhile insurance may seem like an added expense, its benefits often outweigh the costs, especially in times of crisis.

      "When considering the purchase of health insurance, several important factors should be taken into account to ensure you choose a plan that meets your needs and budget. Here are some key factors to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Coverage Options**:\n",
      "   - **Types of Plans**: Understand the different types of health insurance plans available (e.g., HMO, PPO, EPO, POS) and how they work.\n",
      "   - **Essential Health Benefits**: Ensure the plan covers essential health benefits such as hospitalization, outpatient care, preventive services, maternity care, mental health services, and prescription drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Premiums**:\n",
      "   - **Monthly Premium**: Consider how much you can afford to pay each month for coverage. This is the amount you pay regardless of whether you use medical services.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Deductibles**:\n",
      "   - **Annual Deductible**: Look at the deductible amount, which is the amount you must pay out-of-pocket before your insurance starts to cover costs. Higher deductibles often mean lower premiums.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Out-of-Pocket Costs**:\n",
      "   - **Co-pays and Co-insurance**: Understand the co-pays (fixed amounts for specific services) and co-insurance (percentage of costs you pay after meeting your deductible) associated with the plan.\n",
      "   - **Out-of-Pocket Maximum**: Check the maximum amount you would have to pay in a year before the insurance covers 100% of your costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Network of Providers**:\n",
      "   - **In-Network vs. Out-of-Network**: Review the network of doctors, hospitals, and specialists. In-network providers typically cost less than out-of-network providers.\n",
      "   - **Access to Specialists**: Consider how easy it is to see specialists and whether referrals are required.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Prescription Drug Coverage**:\n",
      "   - **Formulary**: Check if your medications are covered and at what cost. Look for a plan with a good formulary that includes your necessary prescriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Preventive Services**:\n",
      "   - **Coverage for Preventive Care**: Ensure the plan covers preventive services (e.g., vaccinations, screenings) without additional costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Customer Service and Support**:\n",
      "   - **Insurance Company Reputation**: Research the insurance company’s reputation for customer service, claims processing, and overall satisfaction.\n",
      "   - **Availability of Support**: Consider whether the insurer offers online tools, mobile apps, or customer support to help you manage your plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Flexibility and Portability**:\n",
      "   - **Plan Flexibility**: Look for plans that allow you to make changes as your health needs change.\n",
      "   - **Portability**: Consider whether the plan can be maintained if you change jobs or move to a different location.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Special Needs**:\n",
      "    - **Chronic Conditions**: If you have chronic health issues, ensure the plan provides adequate coverage for ongoing treatment and management.\n",
      "    - **Family Needs**: Consider the health needs of all family members when selecting a plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Financial Assistance**:\n",
      "    - **Subsidies and Tax Credits**: If you are purchasing insurance through the marketplace, check if you qualify for any subsidies or tax credits to help lower costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Enrollment Periods**:\n",
      "    - **Open Enrollment**: Be aware of the open enrollment period and any special enrollment periods that may apply to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully evaluating these factors, you can make a more informed decision about which health insurance plan is best suited to your needs and financial situation.\n"

    "### **Scenario**: **Verifying health customer**\n",
    "You are building a system to handle medical records where personal medical information needs to be extracted from unstructured text documents. This system will allow healthcare providers to easily categorize and process patient data based on their needs. Your task is to define a structured format for storing key medical information extracted from a patient's medical record.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Given Query**:\n",
    "Here’s an example of a patient's medical document text:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Patient Name: John Doe\n",
    "Date of Birth: 1985-06-15\n",
    "Gender: Male\n",
    "Medical History: John has a history of asthma and seasonal allergies. He underwent a knee surgery in 2018 due to an accident. No known chronic conditions or heart disease. \n",
    "Medications: Currently using Ventolin inhaler for asthma as needed. No regular medications.\n",
    "Allergies: Allergic to penicillin.\n",
    "Emergency Contact: Jane Doe (Wife), 555-1234\n",
    "Primary Care Physician: Dr. Smith, General Practitioner, ABC Health Clinic.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instructions**:\n",
    "1. **Understand the Scenario**: \n",
    "   - In this workshop, your task is to convert the medical document into a structured format that the system can process and store in a database.\n",
    "   - Think about the key pieces of information you would need for a medical record (e.g., patient’s name, medical history, medications, allergies, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define the Data Structure**: \n",
    "   - Based on the given medical document, define a **Pydantic** data model that will represent the important attributes of a patient’s record.\n",
    "   - Consider what fields should be included, such as **name**, **date of birth**, **gender**, **medical history**, **medications**, **allergies**, **emergency contact**, and **primary care physician**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use the Data Model**: \n",
    "   - Your Pydantic model should reflect the data in the medical document.\n",
    "   - Once you've defined the data structure, create a prompt that can be used to extract the necessary details from medical documents in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Key Questions**:\n",
    "   - What fields would be critical for storing a patient’s medical information?\n",
    "   - How can you ensure that this model can handle additional fields in the future (e.g., for future conditions, treatments, or insurance information)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Deliverables**:\n",
    "- Define a Pydantic data model for the personal medical information.\n",
    "- Provide a structured list of fields that should be included in the model (e.g., name, DOB, medications, allergies, etc.)."
