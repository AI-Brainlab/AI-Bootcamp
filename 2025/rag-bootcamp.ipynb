In life insurance several documents are in vogue.The documents stand as a proof of the contract between theinsurer and the insured. The major documents in vogue inlife insurance are premium receipt, insurance policy,endorsements etc.\\n2.1 OBJECTIVEAfter going through this lesson you will be able to\\nzRecall the various documents used in life insurance\\nzLearn the utility of each document.\\n2.2 NEED FOR INSURANCE DOCUMENTATIONLife insurance is a legally enforceable contract between two\\nparties both of whom are legally qualified to contract. It istherefore, necessary that the terms and conditions of theagreement must be suitably documented in a manner thatwould make it clear that both parties to the contract are Ad-idem i.e., of the same mind. Ad-Idem means that both theparties understand the same thing in the same sense or areof the same mind on the same subject. There must beconsensus or Ad-Idem between the parties to the contract.\\nThis is possible provided all the terms and conditions, rights\\nand duties - privileges and obligations are properly documentedin terms which can be clearly interpreted in a court of law.Between  two human beings sometime silence means an2\\nINSURANCE DOCUMENTS'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './docs/m3-f2.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='MODULE - 3\\nPractice of Life Insurance\\nNotes\\n 21Insurance Documents\\nDIPLOMA IN INSURANCE SERVICESacceptance. But as the insurer is a legal personality entitled\\nto contract verbal discussion between parties to the contractis not possible and hence there is a need for documentation.\\nInsurance is also a contract of utmost good faith and enforced\\nonly in the distant future. It is therefore necessary that thedeclarations made by both the parties should be put in blackand white for future reference. Any suppression, willful andmaterial shall make the contract void. The insured, therefore,has a duty to declare all that he knows about himself, hishealth, his financial status in answering questions containedin the proposal form and other ancillary documents whichmay be required by the insurer.\\nWe shall discuss in this chapter the various kinds of documents\\nwhich become necessary at three stages of a policy –\\n(1) at the stage of proposal, which if accepted result into a\\npolicy,\\n(2) during the duration of the policy where several alterations\\nmay become necessary\\n(3) at the end of the policy contract when insurer pays the\\nfinal claim.\\n2.2.1  Documents needed at the stage of the proposal2.2.2 Proposal form  is the basic format which is filled in by\\nthe proposer who wants to take an insurance policy. It can bedefined as  the application for insurance.\\nA proposal form has three portions(1) The first gives details about the proposer , his name,\\naddress, occupation, the details about the type of insurancethat he wants to take and the name of the nominee towhom the money is payable in case the policyholder doesnot survive to take the maturity amount.\\n(2) The second portion relates to the details of the insurance\\npolicy  that the proposer already possesses, the present\\nhealth conditions and the personal history of his health,any sickness or accident he might have had.\\nThis is a detailed questionnaire and the proposer is\\nexpected to reply to each question truthfully and honestly.A female proposer has to reply to certain additionalquestions specific to her gender.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './docs/m3-f2.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='DIPLOMA IN INSURANCE SERVICES\\nMODULE - 3\\nNotesInsurance Documents\\nPractice of Life Insurance\\n 22(3) The last portion of the proposal form relates to the\\ndeclaration.  Through this declaration, the proposer\\n(i) affirms the veracity of the statements made in the\\nproposal form in replying to the question\\n(ii)affirms that he/she has not suppressed,\\nmisrepresented or concealed any fact which may bematerial to the risk\\n(iii)agrees that this declaration along with the proposal\\nform shall form the basis of the contract and if anyinformation is found to be false the contract will benull and void thus reinforcing the principle of“Uberimma Fides” (Utmost good faith).\\n(iv)further agrees to take the insurance on the terms and\\nconditions decided by the insurer.\\nThe proposer further agrees to keep the insurer informed of\\nany changes in the position relating to his health  or hisoccupation between now and the issuance of the first premiumreceipt.\\nIt is thus clear that after the insurer has issued the first\\npremium receipt, the contract is said to have concluded andthereafter the insurer has no right to change the terms of thecontract.\\nHowever, the insurer has a right to offer any term and condition\\nbefore the final acceptance of the insurance. For example, incase of a female proposer, the insurer may not agree to acceptthe risk of the childbirth. In case of certain hazardousoccupation like commercial pilots, the insurer may like toexclude the risk to life due to such occupation.\\nIn case of certain deformity, the risk of accident can be\\nexcluded. These exclusions of risks are not normal terms ofthe policy contract and therefore have to elicit consent of theproposer. In case of a substandard health, the insurer maylike to accept a reduced risk during the first one or two yearsof the insurance. The consent of the insured is a must forsuch limitations to be imposed.\\nAll such special conditions or riders are mentioned in the\\npolicy either by an endorsement or attachment to thedocument. If the insurer has taken a Convertible Whole LifePlan which is to be converted to an endowment plan after 5'),\n",

However it may be noted that agents confidentialreport and the medical examination (confidential) report arenot part of the contract for insurance.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 2.1\\n1. What are the different stages where documentation is\\nrequired?\\n2 Define Proposal Form.\\nThere are certain other documents which may be required at\\nthe proposal stage.\\n2.2.3 Age proofAge is an important factor in deciding the quantum of premium\\nagainst a policy. The document proving the age, i.e. age proofmust be reliable and the insured has to undertake as to itstruthfulness. An insurer accepts these documents as standardage proof -\\n1) Certified extract from municipal records, recorded at the\\ntime of birth.\\n2) Certificate of baptism or extract from Family Bible3) Extract from school or college records.4) Extract from service register in case of employees -\\nGovernment or semi government or such other reputedinstitutions which insist on conclusive evidence of age atthe time of recruitment.\\n5) Identity card issued by Defence department.6) Marriage certificates issued by Roman Catholic Church.7) Domicile certificate.8) Passport.\\nNon-standard age proofs  are those which are comparatively\\nless reliable and therefore the insurer accepts them with apinch of salt. In other words the insurer takes certainprecautions before accepting such age proofs as final.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './docs/m3-f2.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='DIPLOMA IN INSURANCE SERVICES\\nMODULE - 3\\nNotesInsurance Documents\\nPractice of Life Insurance\\n 24For example, such age proofs are examined by a senior officer\\nand not accepted as a matter of routine. Another safeguard isto offer a reduced term of policy so that the policy matures ata comparatively early age. The maximum age of maturity maybe  fixed at a lower age. The insurer even may charge an extrapremium to compensate for the possible understatement ofage in such age proof.\\nSuch non–standard age proofs are  (1) Horoscope, (2) service\\nrecords of employers other than those mentioned above (3)ESI card, (4) Marriage Certificate in case of a  Muslim proposer.,5) Elders Declaration, 6) Self Declaration, 7) Driving Licence,8) Certificate issued by village panchayat, 9) Electoral role,10) Ration card.\\nAge proof is insisted upon for completion of propsoal if the\\ndeclared age of the proposer is less than 20 or more than 50or if the sum proposed is quite high, say above one lakh.\\n2.2.4  Proof of incomeThis document may become necessary whenever the sum\\nproposed is very high. Normally a sum proposed which is sevento eight times of the declared income is acceptable forinsurance. But proposals do come to the insurer when theknown source of income of the proposer is much less comparedto the amount of insurance desired. A service holder normallydoes not face this problem as his sources of income areverifiable.\\nIn case of business people, the assessed income is at times\\nmuch less compared to what is a desirable income for theamount of insurance desired. In such cases the insurer attimes calls for assessed income tax returns, or CharteredAccountant’s certificate etc. Such precautions are necessaryto eliminate the possibility of moral hazard.\\n2.3 DOCUMENTS NEEDED DURING THE CONTINUANCE\\nOF THE POLICY:\\n2.3.1 First Premium Receipts and Renewal Premium\\nReceipts\\nThe First Premium Receipt (FPR) is the confirmation of\\ninsurance . This document is important as it gives the date of\\nassumption of the risk but its value is nil once the policydocument has been issued.'),\n",

The insured buys not the policycontract, but the right to the sum of money and its futuredelivery. The insurer on its part promises to pay a sum ofmoney, provided of course the insured keeps its part of promiseof paying the installments of premium as scheduled.\\nThe  pre-amble to the insurance contract makes the above\\nstatement clear and states that this policy is issued subject tothe conditions and privileges printed on the back of the policy.The endorsements placed on the policy shall also be part ofthe policy and it also makes a reference to the proposal formsaying that that the statements given in the proposal form arethe basis of the contract.\\nThe schedule which is printed on the policy document\\nidentifies the office which has issued the policy. It states thename of the policyholder, the date of commencement of thepolicy, an identification number of the policy called policynumber. This number is extremely useful for making anyreference to the insurer relating to this policy. This shall avoidneedless delay.\\nBeneficiary’s name is also mentioned along with address.It is necessary to check that it is correct and any mistake\\nshould be immediately pointed out for correction. A mistakein the address may misdirect the premium notices and anyother future correspondence. It also states the name of thenominee and the date upto which premium has to be paid.The schedule goes on to mention, the type of policy, on thehappening of which, the sum assured is payable and to whomit is payable. It of course also mentions when and how longthe premium is to be paid.\\nThe policy document is signed by an official of the insurer\\nand dated and stamped as per the provision of the Stamp Actto make it a completely legally enforceable document.\\n2.3.3 Renewal Premium ReceiptsThough it is the duty of the insured to pay the renewal\\npremium on the due date the insurer sends a renewal premiumnotice to the insured out of courtesy and on receiving the'),\n",

An insurance policy, in this sense iscalled an unilateral contract.\\nAll such alterations as are discussed hereafter are effected by\\nendorsements on the policy document.\\nThe following alterations are not permitted.(1) Alterations during the first year,\\n(2) Alteration from one class of assurance to another where\\nthe premium scale is reduced.\\n(3) Alteration to another plan which is more risk oriented.(4) Increase in sum assured in the same policy.\\nThe following alterations are allowed1) Limiting the premium paying period, but date of maturity\\nremaining unaltered;\\n2) Change in the mode of payment of premium e.g. Half-\\nyearly to yearly or half-yearly to quarterly;\\n3) Alteration due to age admission, if required, has to be\\ncompulsorily done;\\n4) Alteration or correction in the name of the assured/\\nnominee;\\n5) Bringing the policy under salary savings scheme;6) Replacing a limiting clause by an extra premium. For\\nexample the first pregnancy clause can be replaced by anone time extra  premium of Rs.5/- per thousand;'),\n",

Forexample, an extra premium imposed for hernia orhydrocele can be removed after surgical operation.Similarly, an occupational  extra premium can be removed,if there is change in occupation to a less hazardous one.However an occupational extra premium cannot beimposed, after the policy has been issued, even if thepolicyholder takes up a more hazardous job.\\nAll such alterations are effected by an endorsement on the\\nback of the policy or by a separate memo which becomes apart of the policy.\\n2.3.5 Duplicate policy :\\nA policy document is a valuable document and can be used\\nfor mortgage etc. Loss of policy document does not absolvethe insurer from the liability of payment of policy proceedswhen the claim arises. The claim can be settled on theclaimants, furnishing an indemnity bond jointly with onesurety.\\nIf a policy is irrevocably lost, a duplicate policy can be issued,\\nafter following a certain procedure. The insurer satisfies itselfof the circumstances leading to loss. Being so satisfied theinsurer insists upon an advertisement in a news paper,production of an indemnity bond and payment of policypreparation charges and there after a duplicate policy is issued.The duplicate policy is stamped “Duplicate Policy”.\\n2.3.6 Nomination:Generally nomination is made at the time of taking a policy.\\nIn case it is not done, it is possible to make nominationsubsequently by an endorsement on the policy. It is alsopossible to change a nomination subsequently by anendorsement. After marriage, such change in nomination isnormally required.\\n2.3.7 AssignmentAn assignment of a policy in favour of another person or\\ninstitution can be effected by an endorsement on the policy.Re-assignment can also be done by a subsequent endorsementon the same policy.'),\n",

The insured loses the valuableprotection that the life assurance policy ensures. The insurerloses because without the renewal premium coming, theheavy expenses which it incurs in the beginning of a policycannot be compensated. Every insurer will, therefore, take allpossible actions to reduce policy-lapses and if lapsed, to getthe policy revived.\\nAn insurer therefore sends out regular premium notices even\\nthough it is not a legal requirement.\\n1) Premium notice is usually sent before the due date of the\\npremium. An insurer is not legally obliged to send apremium notice. It is a matter of courtesy and greatlyhelps the life assured for timely payment of premium.\\n2) Premium default notice : This notice is sent within 3\\nmonths after the due date reminding the policyholder topay the premium to prevent the policy-lapses.\\n3) Issue of Final lapse notice : If  the premium is not paid\\nwithin six months of the due date, and the policy is allowedto lapse, this notice is issued to the policyholder requestinghim to revive the policy to restore the full insurance cover.\\n4) Intimation to agent : Agent  being vitally concerned with\\nthe continuance of a policy, he is also suitably informedevery time so that  he can contact the policyholder forpayment of the premium.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 1.2\\n1.
